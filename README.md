# TourRadar 
## Automation Engineer (QA) Test Case

### Context

Here at TourRadar, the fastest growing start up in Austria and the world's largest touring market, we want to bring new features to our customers as fast as possible while at the same time keeping the quality bar at the highest standard. Therefore we do a LOT of releases 
daily and we rely on our automation suite to make sure that all the new features as well as the already implemented ones work as intended.

The [Europe Tours](https://www.tourradar.com/d/europe ) page is your sandbox to answer the below questions.


### Questions we ask you to answer:
1. How would a test plan that describes the different sections of the web page for more efficient test management look like? Explain your decision.
2. Based on test plan you created above, choose 5 sections of the page and write an automated end-to-end tests for each of these areas (5 tests in total, 1 test per section).\
*Example:* "Filtering by age range or download a brochure, etc."\
Please **do not** write 2 duplicate tests, e.g sort by price ascending; sort by price descending!\
**Note:** While implementing the test cases do so with maintenance, scalability and performance as primary concerns given how large test suites can become in a short span of time.
3. Devise a security test that covers one of following scenarios:\
a. Testing for CSRF vulnerabilities on all forms of the pages OR \
b. Testing for brute force attacks on login page OR \
c. Testing for basic XSS vulnerability on pages \
Feel free to use any tool or script to automate this process.

### Which programming languages/frameworks may I use?
You can use any languages/frameworks which serve the purpose.
Make sure to include a README on how to run the testsuite.

## When is this test case due?
You should submit the solution to this testcase within 72 hours.

## How to ask questions?
Is there something ambiguous in the test case? Some of the ambiguity has been intentionally left in there to give room to your creativity.

If there is a question that appears to be a blocker, please head over to issues and create a New Issue. Make sure to assign the newly created issue to one of the available options (except tourradar-testcases). Being explicit in your question will help us provide better and more contextual answers. 

## How to submit?
- Create a new branch in this repository.
- Add your solution in a subdirectory; say *solution* in that branch.
- Save all scripts in separate files, together with a document explaining your choices and the decisions you made while planning and executing the tasks.
- Push the branch to this repository.
- Create a new Pull Request for your branch against `master`.
- When creating a Pull Request, please add all the reviewers (except tourradar-testcases) from the "Reviewers" panel on the right hand 
## How does the review process happen?
- One or more TourRadar Engineers will go through your solution and leave their feedback.
- Based on our evaluation of your solution, a decision will be made about whether to advance you in the progress.
- Once the solution has been reviewed and evaluated, our Recruiting team will get back to you with next steps.
